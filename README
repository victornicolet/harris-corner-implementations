The project presents different implementations of Harris's Corner Detection
Algorithm.

- bench_source/ contains the source files and the python top-level benchmarking
suite from https://github.com/bondhugula/polymage-benchmarks.git ( Ravi Teja
Mullapudi, Vinay Vasista, CSA Indian Institute of Science).

- backups/ contains mostly previous versions of "dyntile" ( dynamic task scheduling
into the static overlapping tiles), and other code backups.

- logs/ contains test logs and small performance measures

- profiling/ ( on branch profiling-records) contains profiles from two tools :
Intel VTune Amplifier XE 2015 and perf

- the parent directory contains the C++ top-level ( not working with all
versions of the algorithm).


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Make :
  make $(LIB)= harris compiles the shared library with the $(LIB) implementation to be used by the test

  With $(LIB) one of the following :
  NO_OVERLAP DYN OPT NAIVE SEQ OPT_R ALIGNED LIB_PREFIX

  make mtests compiles the test file

==> Run a test : ./mtest (IMAGE) (NRUNS)
